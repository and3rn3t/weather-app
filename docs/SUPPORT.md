## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Is Andernet Weather free?**
A: Yes, completely free with no ads, in-app purchases, or subscriptions.

**Q: What iOS version is required?**
A: iOS 26.0 or later (the app uses Liquid Glass).

**Q: Does it work offline?**
A: Recently loaded forecasts are cached on your device, so you can often view them offline. New data requires an internet connection.

**Q: Where does the weather data come from?**
A: Forecasts come from Open-Meteo, a free, open-source weather API. US severe-weather alerts come from the National Weather Service, radar tiles from RainViewer, and pollen data (Europe) from Tomorrow.io.

### Location & Privacy

**Q: Why does the app need my location?**
A: To provide accurate weather forecasts for your current area. Location is only used for weather data.

**Q: Is my location tracked or shared?**
A: We don't track you or sell your location. To get a forecast, the app sends the coordinates of the place you are viewing to its weather providers (Open-Meteo, plus the National Weather Service for US alerts, RainViewer for radar and Tomorrow.io for pollen in Europe). The app also caches coordinates with recent weather on your device so it can show them offline. See the [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for details.

**Q: Can I use the app without location services?**
A: Yes! Search for any city manually or save favorite locations.

**Q: What's "Always Allow" location used for?**
A: Optional feature to auto-update widgets and provide location-based notifications. You can use "While Using" instead.

### Features

**Q: How do I add favorite locations?**
A: Search for a city, then tap the star icon to save it as a favorite.

**Q: How do I add widgets?**
A: Long-press your Home Screen → tap "+" → search "Andernet Weather" → choose size → Add Widget.

**Q: Do Live Activities work?**
A: Yes! Start a Live Activity from the main screen to show weather on your Lock Screen and Dynamic Island.

**Q: Can I change temperature units?**
A: Yes, go to Settings → choose Celsius (°C) or Fahrenheit (°F).

**Q: What weather data is shown?**

- Current temperature and "feels like"
- Hourly forecast (24 hours)
- 7-day forecast
- Precipitation probability and amount
- Wind speed and direction
- Humidity percentage
- UV Index
- Air Quality Index (AQI)
- Sunrise/sunset times

### Widgets

**Q: Why isn't my widget updating?**
A: iOS limits widget refresh frequency. Widgets typically update every 15-60 minutes. Open the app to force refresh.

**Q: Can I customize widget appearance?**
A: Widgets adapt to your chosen theme from Settings. More customization options coming soon.

**Q: Widget shows "No Data"?**
A: This means the app hasn't fetched weather yet. Open the app once to initialize data.

### Notifications

**Q: How do I enable weather alerts?**
A: Settings → Notifications → Enable weather alerts. You can customize alert types and timing.

**Q: I'm not receiving notifications.**
A: Check iOS Settings → Andernet Weather → Notifications → ensure "Allow Notifications" is enabled.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: The app won't open or crashes.**

1. Force quit the app (swipe up in App Switcher)
2. Restart your device
3. If issue persists, delete and reinstall
4. Report the issue via TestFlight Feedback

**Q: Weather data seems inaccurate.**
A: Open-Meteo provides accurate forecasts, but weather can be unpredictable. Try refreshing (pull down on main screen).

**Q: Location won't update.**

1. Check iOS Settings → Privacy & Security → Location Services → Andernet Weather
2. Ensure permission is "While Using" or "Always"
3. Try toggling location services off/on
4. Restart the app

**Q: Maps won't load.**

1. Check internet connection
2. Ensure MapKit isn't restricted (Settings → Screen Time → Content & Privacy)
3. Try force-refreshing the map

**Q: Settings aren't saving.**
A: This is a bug! Please report via TestFlight with steps to reproduce.

### Beta Testing (TestFlight)

**Q: How do I provide feedback?**

1. **TestFlight Feedback:** Shake device while in-app → "Send Beta Feedback"
2. **Screenshots:** Take screenshot → "Send to Developer" in TestFlight
3. **Email:** <support@andernet.dev> with device model and iOS version
4. **GitHub:** File an issue at github.com/and3rn3t/weather-app

**Q: What should I test?**

- All major features (search, favorites, maps, widgets)
- Different locations (international cities)
- Widget refresh behavior
- Live Activities
- Accessibility features (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type)
- Dark/Light mode switching
- Different network conditions

**Q: Will my data transfer to the App Store version?**
A: Yes, if you use the same Apple ID. Favorites and settings persist.

**Q: Can I install both TestFlight and App Store versions?**
A: No, they share the same bundle ID, so only one can be installed at a time. Install the App Store version over the beta without deleting the app first, so your favorites and settings are kept.

### Known Issues

**Current Beta Limitations:**

- WeatherParticle effects temporarily disabled (will return in next update)
- Some international locations may need manual search
- Widget refresh timing controlled by iOS (not customizable)

### Accessibility

**Q: Does the app support VoiceOver?**
A: Yes! All interactive elements have accessibility labels. Report any missing labels.

**Q: Can I increase text size?**
A: Yes, the app respects iOS Dynamic Type settings (Settings → Accessibility → Display & Text Size).

**Q: Does it support Reduce Motion?**
A: Yes, animations are simplified when Reduce Motion is enabled.
